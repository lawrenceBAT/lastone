<p><span>What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy?
</span>Shallow copies duplicate as little as possible. A shallow copy of a collection is a copy of the collection
    structure, not the elements. With a shallow copy, two collections now share the individual elements.
    Deep copies duplicate everything. A deep copy of a collection is two collections with all of the elements in the
    original collection duplicated.</p>
<p><span>what is callback?</span>A "callback" is any function that is called by another function which takes the
    first function as a parameter. （在一个函数中调用另外一个函数就是callback）</p>
